Insights into Food Adulteration Trends and Analysis

# **Food Adulteration Trends - Tableau Dashboard**

**"Being someone who loves food, I was curious to explore the hidden risks behind what we consume daily. This curiosity inspired me to create a Tableau visualization dashboard using a simulated dataset to analyze food adulteration trends, risks, and patterns."**

## **Project Overview** 🌟  
Food adulteration is a major concern impacting public health, regulatory authorities, and industries worldwide. This dashboard provides a detailed **analysis of adulteration incidents** across products, categories, and adulterants, offering insights to identify patterns, risks, and actionable strategies for ensuring food safety.

## **Objective 🎯**
The primary goal of this project is to:
1. **Identify products and categories** with high health risks due to adulteration.
2. Analyze **adulteration trends over time** to observe patterns or spikes.
3. Explore **adulterants** and their distribution across food categories.
4. Use storytelling and interactivity to deliver meaningful insights.

## **Motivation Behind the Project**  
As a food enthusiast, I wanted to bring attention to food safety issues in a visually impactful way. Using Tableau, I aimed to transform data into actionable insights that can help:
- Consumers become more informed.  
- Authorities focus on high-risk areas.  
- Industries address safety gaps effectively.  

## **Dashboard Highlights 📊**
